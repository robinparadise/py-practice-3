### Exercises

**Objective:** In this exercise, students will create a simple game in Python. Each group will use Git branches to develop different aspects of the game and apply Python loops and functions.

**Instructions:**

1. **Setting Up Your Git Repository:**

   - Each group should have a Git repository shared among its members.
   - Choice a leader of the repository.
   - Initialize the repository with a `main` branch.
   - Create a remote repository on a Git hosting service, and make sure all group members have access.

3. **Git Branches:**

   Each group member is responsible for developing a specific feature of the game:

   - **Group Member 1: `feature/exercise-1`**
     - Create a new branch named `feature/exercise-1` from the `main` branch.
     - Implement exercise-1
     - Commit your changes in the `feature/exercise-1` branch.

   - **Group Member 2: `feature/exercise-2`**
     - Create a new branch named `feature/exercise-2` from the `main` branch.
     - Implement exercise-2
     - Commit your changes in the `feature/exercise-2` branch.

   - **Group Member 2: `feature/exercise-3`**
     * Create a new branch named `feature/exercise-3` from the `main` branch.
     * Implement exercise-3
     * Commit your changes in the `feature/exercise-3` branch.

4. **Integrate Features:**

   - Merge the changes from all the feature branches into the `main` branch.

6. **Collaborate and Test:**

   - Collaborate to ensure that all the features work together smoothly.
   - Test the game thoroughly and make improvements as needed.

7. **Git Collaboration:**

   - Ensure that commits are clear and meaningful, and that all group members are informed about changes.
   - Encourage group members to review each other's code and discuss any issues or improvements.

8. **Final Presentation:**

   - Discuss the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the benefits of teamwork and version control using Git.
